	<h1>About me</h1>
	<p>Hi! My name is Karthik Mahesh and I am a final year undergraduate at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, India. I've always been fascinated by airplanes, and my main interests lie in the fields of Aircraft Design and Aerodynamics, particularly design of supersonic transports.</p>
  <p>I'm currently working on Sonic Boom minimization in Supersonic jets as part of my Bachelor's Thesis under Prof. Avijit Chatterjee, and have my hands in multiple other design projects here at IIT.</p>
  <p>I spent this summer as an intern at Boeing (Boeing India Engineering and Technology Centre, Bengaluru), where I helped create a platform to accelerate the design and analysis of whiffletrees for aircraft structural testing using automation. I interfaced between CATIA and Microsoft Excel using the VBA language, formulated a new method to design a whiffletree based on the physics of the problem and the input geometry, and effected a potential time saving of 50% in the process.</p>
  <p>I headed the institute's Aeromodelling club from April 2018 to March 2017, and organised multiple events with a view to introduce freshmen to model airplanes, and organised the first acrobatic model airshows under the institute technical council.</p>
