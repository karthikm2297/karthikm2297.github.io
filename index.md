#Welcome to my homepage

I'm glad you are here. I'm an aerospace engineering student who's been fascinated with planes since I was 5 years old. I also love tinkering with anything and everything, be it machines, code, or maths. I plan to talk about my projects and stuff I learn along the way. You can also find my CV and project documentation if you want to tinker with what I've done.
